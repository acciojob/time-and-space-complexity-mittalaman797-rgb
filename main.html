	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

	<p>
		Time complexity describes how the running time of an algorithm grows with input size.
		Choosing algorithms with better Time complexity often results in more efficient programs,
		especially for large inputs.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> measures the extra memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size;
		for instance, using a single counter is O(1) space, while storing a copy of the input may take O(n).
